# Blockchain
This repository contains my first smart contract developed using Solidity deployed on Blockchain network .

# What is Blockchain
According to Wikipedia, A blockchain, originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data. 

In other words it is a verifiable, immutable, tamper-proof, evergrowing ledger.

This smart contract is deployed on Ropsten Test Network.
I've used metamask wallet for transactions, Ethereum testnet faucet for accessing few test ethers for the purpose of mining the block to the network.

The deployed contract can be found here.
